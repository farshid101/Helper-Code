***
To convert your dataset into a tensor for TensorFlow, you first need to import the TensorFlow library and then load your dataset into a NumPy array or a Pandas DataFrame. Once you have your data in a suitable format, you can convert it to a TensorFlow tensor using the tf.convert_to_tensor() function.
***
import tensorflow as tf
import pandas as pd

# Assuming you have loaded your dataset into a Pandas DataFrame called 'df'
# If you have your data in a NumPy array, you can directly use it instead of a DataFrame

# Convert the DataFrame to a NumPy array
data_np = df.to_numpy()

# Create a TensorFlow tensor from the NumPy array
data_tensor = tf.convert_to_tensor(data_np, dtype=tf.float32)  # Adjust the dtype as needed


//end code
