If we do not know the history of the theft of that pond, our next generation will remain ignorant about it. So everyone needs to know that. To build that road, the total cost of the people of Bangladesh is about 11 thousand (11,000) crores, that is, every one (01) km. About 2 hundred (200) crore rupees have been spent to build the road or about 6 lakh 9 thousand 570 rupees have been spent to build one (01) foot of road. Yes, you read correctly that people spent 609,570 taka per foot of road, which is six (06) times more than the average cost in the whole world! Can you guess the amount of theft? If not, what else can we do but sit with our hands on our cheeks, right? Do we think that the corrupt secretary, engineer, minister or prime minister who approved the project of the pond should be punished? Then look at another scenario. Then you can easily understand the type of punishment. If the same thing happened in China and their corrupt bureaucrats were caught, everyone involved would be executed by firing squad. All their greed and lust would end. Instead of 10,000 crores, 30,000 crores have been spent on the Padma bridge on the lame argument that the Padma river is a very dry river, but the ground of the Dhaka-Mawa road was covered with Sheela hills, which cost six (06) times more because the mountains had to be cut to build it?

There is no technical, modern, strong, experience to work considering the future generation. Thinking about how to deceive the country and the people of the country with false pretexts of theft, bribery, nepotism. After service to the country, the country's wealth and people's sufferings are looted and accumulated mountains of wealth abroad, children travel in luxury, giving jobs to relatives, things worth 1 rupee, 2000 rupees, 3 years of work not completed in 10 years, making mistakes in planning, not working according to plan in the future, doing 6 new works and getting wasted again, they get an excuse to take money. Working without analysis. 1/ Strict laws should be made and laws should be respected. Discipline rules should be brought under the new system in every place. CCTV should be arranged in all places. All government administrations should work and operate in all offices by maintaining law and order. 2/ If the country's resources are destroyed or stolen, the punishment will be wooden. Putimachas should be caught and hidden for public display. The main owners of big ruikatlad should be brought out. no matter who Expulsion, military dismissal, transfer, three-party committee, the real owners cannot be caught through system and money. Those who investigate are also involved in irregularities and corruption. These scams must be stopped. Those who investigate with RAB members serve as friends of the common people. Planned according to 3/150/200 years, Bus Trains should be provided in all directions. 12 lanes should be widened in Oligli and rural roads, underpass roads and new road laws should be made. Work should be done properly. Education, health, food, there are big irregularities-corruption business inside, it should be stopped, work should be done in a modern and strong way. No one should go abroad for treatment. Therefore, all the development works should be analyzed properly together. No one should suffer harassment in the name of service. Whoever has to work honestly for the country in his sector, then believe that there will be no crime of irregularity-corruption in the country. 4/Leaders, Ministers, Officials and college students in all offices of government, private, autonomous administration should take compulsory army training after completing the 4-month course and become country leaders and serve the country and the helpless and innocent people of the country. Irregularities-corruption inside the administration, bribery, should be stopped which is not possible. All the small and big incidents in the police stations should be reported to the SP and not to any other officer in charge. 5/ Assigning all the developmental works of the country to the big or small army or working in consultation with their engineers.

            "; See - 40 / 50 years ago when roads were built in Dhaka city or outside Dhaka, the countrymen did not say that roads were built in an unplanned manner. Those who were in charge of designing or planning these roads were not hawkers or day laborers. They have degrees from colleges, universities. Now after 40 / 45 years, Bengalis are getting Hush. Now the Bengalis are realizing that the plan was wrong. The real reason for this realization is the current intern juggernaut. 50 years ago when there was no Internet, but the roads of different countries in Europe and America were well planned. Their countrymen no longer complain that the roads were unplanned.¬† Now, the difference between Bangladeshi urban planners and European urban planners is education. The knowledge of Bangladeshi engineers is limited to books, they don't know or can't do anything outside of that. Now because of the internet, they have learned something outside of books. See, this takes different borrowings. So borrowing is knowledge. Evidence of this abounds across the country. Dhaka city has many built in which there are serious mistakes somewhere. What happens if you learn by watching this!! Those under supervision do not have the capacity to think in any way.¬†¬†Currently, various projects are being worked on under the supervision of Bangladeshi engineers. Like the people of the country 40 / 45 years ago, you will give all these jobs now.¬† Because you yourself don't know where the mistake is going. The problem is - 40 / 45 years from now when your child realizes it will not be possible to repeat this mistake.¬† In Bangladesh, many new roads can be built because there are still many vacant places. Imagine the population of this small Bangladesh after 50 years. In the last 12 years, the current government has wasted hundreds of kilometers of space by building unplanned flyovers all over Dhaka city. Think how much the countrymen would have benefited if the metro-rail was built on those roads first instead of these unplanned flyovers.¬†¬†¬†< =\"://../?=78\">://../?=78</><>So thinking about the future Bangladesh should go down every road. Up will run , , the car and down will run parallel to , . If roads are built like this, there will be no floods in Bangladesh in the future.¬† These will have endless fish.¬† There will be so much fish that even the poor people can eat 3 meals of fish and rice every day.¬†¬†In Bangladesh, those who want to take various high government positions (chairman, mayor, etc.), want to take responsibility for the development of the country, it is very indispensable for the people to know the level of their general knowledge. I think those who fight or fight to get all these posts should get a wow.¬† This should be. They will be given some example of the country and they will be asked to solve it in their own mind.¬† Even though it is not in Bangladesh, the election must be held and he should not be given that post if he passes this election. They will be made of general knowledge and they should be appointed on the basis of how many rational solutions they provide.¬† And telephone lines will be open for the people of the country. Bangladesh is neither father's country nor son-in-law's country. This country is the people's country. 30 people made this country independent. A public vote will determine whether he is fit for the post. This also applies to Hasina. Since they campaign to get power, they want to sit in the chair of power for the development of the country, improvement of the condition of the people, so their intelligence should be tested before they are put in power.¬† It is necessary to check whether their intelligence or what level of intelligence they will develop the country. {'neg': 0.059, 'neu': 0.874, 'pos': 0.066, 'compound': 0.7051}\n",

            "No country buys every year. A train is purchased for a minimum of 40 years. Hasina will now buy a single-decker train to run on Paddha Setu for a minimum of 40 years. That means no more double-deck trains or metros can be expected in 40 years. Or if after 5 or 10 years the government buys double-decker trains by spending tax money again, what will these single-decker trains do? Would you say that any other line will provide these single-decker trains? In this way, the government will first buy single-decker trains in each sector and then buy double-decker trains with a new budget?¬†¬†Double-deck trains are another convenience factor for people. Let me explain to you - the railway authority calculated that the sale of 1000 rupees was fixed for each compartment in order to make a profit on the train service. If a ticket is sold at Rs 1000 for each compartment, there will be more profit on fuel and other expenses. Now suppose a train compartment with one floor has 50 passengers. The Rs 1,000 ticket sold by the Ministry of Railways is for 50 passengers.¬† (1000 50 = 20) Ticket fare per passenger is supposed to be 20 taka. Now, if you consider a double-deck train compartment, you can comfortably seat at least 80 to 90 passengers in 1st and 2nd floor combined.¬† Now you divide 1000 rupees by 80 passengers ( 1000 80 = 12.25 ) Now you see that due to double-deck train the fare of passengers is also lower. People get another benefit.¬†¬†< =\"://../?=7\">://../?=7&;=328¬†</> ¬†<>If seeking the good of people is not positive, then which is positive bro?¬†Isn't it positive to think about how people will benefit more?¬† Let me tell you how people can benefit from double-decker trains. Why do you call it unfair to want good for the people? If you want the good of the people of the country, why is your liver on fire, brother? I just said that the people would have got more benefits in the double-deck train. Bangladesh is neither the country of one's father nor the country of one's son-in-law, right? The country belongs to the people, you must not deny it, because you are also the people.¬† And who is the champion of corruption and who is left behind is not my concern. It's a matter of politicians, what do you say brother? I, you are the common people. We think how people can benefit!! ; . ; . {'neg': 0.039, 'neu': 0.855, 'pos': 0.106, 'compound': 0.9811}\n",

We want a free, independent Bangladesh. There are various types of crimes including irregularities and corruption. If our forefathers had planned for a good 150/200 years and made strict laws and proper sustainable standards for the future generations, then the country would have progressed further. We must understand that we are a nation of thieves. The country of gold is full of thieves' mines. 100 / By leaving out the 150-year plan, brothers did jigsaws on the year of Nazrul Rabindranath's birth and death. They can, but they cannot plan what to do later for the helpless, poor and miserable people of the country. There is no skill, experience, quality experts. There is no technical, modern, strong, experience to work considering the future generation. Thinking about how to deceive the country and the people of the country with false pretexts of theft, bribery, nepotism. After service to the country, the country's wealth and people's sufferings are looted and accumulated mountains of wealth abroad, children travel in luxury, giving jobs to relatives, things worth 1 rupee, 2000 rupees, 3 years of work not completed in 10 years, making mistakes in planning, not working according to the plan in the future, doing 6 works again and getting wasted, they get an excuse to take money.

I think Bangabandhu's daughter will end up committing suicide to die without eating the people's shoes. Hasina will consider soul-killing better than people's shoes house. &;Vote robbery = dishonesty with the people.&; Hasina has taken power by being dishonest with the people. Hasina has seized power by treating the people of the country unfairly. The biggest proof that you are a citizen of a country is your right to vote. Hasina deprived the people of Bangladesh of that right to vote. Rape League workers and supporters say - Hasina's popularity is high, Hasina is not a public leader. Father of the Nation Sheikh Mujib's daughter's popularity is so high that she has to steal votes to gain power. What can be more shameful than this !! Hasina should commit suicide. What could be more shameful than this? If the daughter of the father of the nation has to rob people's votes to come to power, then all kinds of injustices are permissible for Ananya's political party. See - there are many patriots like Magistrate Sarwar Alam, Barrister Suman who have been unfairly removed. Those who tried to do good things for the country but the people of Hasina's gang got angry and removed these good people with Ghiringi Panch. The whole of Bangladesh knows that these people are doing good things for the country and Hasina will not know, surprise!! Doesn't Hasina have the power to give more power to these good people so that they can do more good work and encourage good people. Hasina certainly can, but instead of doing it, Hasina does not give these good people any dignity for their work. Hasina is missing and killing hundreds of people, she is not answerable to anyone and this little work is not possible for Hasina? Hasina is the leader of all those who are doing these inhuman acts one after another. Hasina should reward Barrister Suman for his work. The health minister is one of Hasina's top 3 favorite people. The health minister has played one of the roles of the government in Hasina's vote robbery. And barrister Sumon spoke against the health minister, will Hasina release Sumon?? Rape League has come down to the competition in militant-style. The Dharshan League will henceforth be at the forefront of militancy because that is (according to its supporters) the ideology of Bangabandhu.  One by one, its ministers are doing militant-drinking and saying &; It is the ideal of Banga-buddy. &; Rape League is proving to 17 crore countrymen that it is the last terrorist.

This extraordinary success is a great honor for the people of Bangladesh, the Bangladesh of Bangabandhu's dream is very much on the map of the world. Reached a better place !! I am originally from Burdwan district of West Bengal, but I was waiting, one day I will go and see the Padma Setu in person !! Finally, I do not have the courage to judge the merits of Sheikh Hasinaji, his actions !! All I can say is that for all the work my mother used to do for our good, we did not thank her separately, we did not greet her with a bouquet of flowers!! The smile of satisfaction on our face was our mother's reward, greeting, everything!! I think that the smile of satisfaction on the face of millions of people of Bangladesh is the biggest debt even to Hon. I wish this to God!! I have two wishes, one- I will go to Bangabandhu's mausoleum and pay my respects!! Two- If there are no protocol obstacles, then I will meet Sheikh Hasinaji and congratulate her for this overall success and pay her respects!! !!All be well, salute !!!!Victory to Bangabandhu, Victory to gold, Victory to Bangladesh !!!!!! {'neg': 0.057, 'neu': 0.697, 'pos': 0.246, 'compound': 0.996}\n",

Said about various fears. The air was heavy with various rumors and speculations. Sheikh Hasina went ahead almost alone with this unwavering confidence that such a big project can be done with her own money. He made the impossible possible. Padma Setu is perhaps his greatest contribution to the people of Bengal. Man is mortal, but this bridge will keep his memory alive. It is a surprising fact that this could happen with Bangladesh's own financial capacity, overcoming all obstacles. Padma Setu restored the waning courage of the Bengalis. What Padma Setu will give us in the future is the next thing. For now its greatest achievement is to restore our lost courage. Sheikh Hasina has come through many hardships so far. In a brutal murder in 1975, he lost almost all of his family. His life has been attempted repeatedly. He survived several times somehow. Maybe that darkness was supposed to destroy him from the inside. But each time he stood tall. Proceeded with a very positive determination.

Leaving the busyness of the day, I was wandering here and there. Somewhere near the evening, the Azaan is being given on the microphones of some mosques. According to the government's instructions, shops and shopping malls are supposed to be closed by 8 pm. Some shops have closed. Suddenly the cell phone rang, I saw my sonmani calling. Picking up the phone, he said, Dad, there is a good news.... What's up mommy, without saying it, toot toot toot. The line was cut. Husband and wife, we live in Jurain in Dhaka, the girl lives with her maternal grandmother in Shariatpur. I immediately called back. Without receiving the call, I heard the girl's unbridled excitement. Do you know, father, there is a happy news tomorrow... what is it, mommy. Hey, listen tomorrow, padma bridge, Udbhodan Aibo. You go. Khali, shaking hands with Sekh Hasina, Aiba. My daughter has really grown up. He does not understand politics. Awami League-BNP do not understand. He may have understood it by hearing it from his mouth and watching it on TV. Tomorrow something is going to happen in Padmapad. This enthusiasm, this emotion, this pride is not unique to Sona Moni. It is the firm conviction of the people of Bangladesh to hold their heads high. With such emotional joy of the girl, my emotions, love and joy about the Padma Bridge increased thousands of times. Mukh Heke Kenjani Apna some words came out. Yes, father, I will go to Jamu, Sheikh Hasina. I will go to Sheikh Hasina. Yes, father, Sheikh Hasina called me. He said, I will stay at home. In the morning, I will take you. I will take you, father, go. If it were me, I would go with you. Photo Tuila Aino. Mamigo, give me the picture on the mobile. Overjoyed, I hung up the phone. Kenjani got up with a cut on the body. I wiped my eyes full of emotion with both hands.

Now, in the name of development, in the name of dream strategy, irregularity-corruption, bribery, extortion by selling the name of oil, extortion, illegal possession, drug addiction, dirty nepotism, fraud, lying, talking beautifully and looking educated. We want a free, independent Bangladesh. There are various crimes including irregularities and corruption. If our forefathers had planned for a good 150/200 years and worked for strict laws and proper sustainable standards for the future generations, then the country would have progressed further. We must understand that we are a nation of thieves. The country of gold is full of thieves' mines. 150 / By leaving out the 200-year plan, brothers did jigsaws on Nazrul Rabindranath's year of birth and death. They can, but they cannot plan what to do later for the helpless, poor, and miserable people of the country. There is no skill, experience, quality experts. There is no technical, modern, strong, experience to work considering the future generation. Thinking about how to deceive the country and the people of the country with false pretexts of theft, bribery, nepotism. After service to the country, the country's wealth and people's sufferings are looted and accumulated mountains of wealth abroad, children travel in luxury, giving jobs to relatives, things worth 1 rupee, 2000 rupees, 3 years of work not completed in 10 years, making mistakes in planning, not working according to plan in the future, doing 6 new works and getting wasted again, they get an excuse to take money. Working without analysis. 1/ Strict laws should be made and laws should be respected. Discipline rules should be brought under the new system in every place. CCTV should be arranged in all places. All government administrations should work and operate in all offices by maintaining law and order. 2/ If the country's resources are destroyed or stolen, the punishment will be wooden. Putimachas should be caught and hidden for public display. The main owners of big ruikatlad should be brought out. no matter who Expulsion, military dismissal, transfer, three-party committee, the real owners cannot be caught through system and money. Those who investigate are also involved in irregularities and corruption. These scams must be stopped. Those who investigate with RAB members serve as friends of the common people. Planned according to 3/150/200 years, Bus Trains should be provided in all directions. 12 lanes should be widened in Oligli and rural roads, underpass roads and new road laws should be made. Work should be done properly. Education, health, food, there are big irregularities-corruption business inside, it should be stopped, work should be done in a modern and strong way. No one should go abroad for treatment. Therefore, all the development works should be analyzed properly together. No one should suffer harassment in the name of service. Whoever has to work honestly for the country in his sector, then believe that there will be no crime of irregularity-corruption in the country. 4/Leaders, Ministers, Officials and college students in all offices of government, private, autonomous administration should take compulsory army training after completing the 4-month course and become country leaders and serve the country and the helpless and innocent people of the country. Irregularities-corruption inside the administration, bribery, should be stopped which is not possible. All the small and big incidents in the police stations should be reported to the SP and not to any other officer in charge. 5/ Assigning all the developmental works of the country to the big or small army or working in consultation with their engineers. They think about the future generation and work according to the thought plan that they do not have to give their hands even in 150 / 200 years to see the sustainable quality. {'neg': 0.121, 'neu': 0.803, 'pos': 0.075, 'compound': -0.988}\n",

            "; See - 40 / 50 years ago when roads were built in Dhaka city or outside Dhaka, the countrymen did not say that roads were built in an unplanned manner. Those who were in charge of designing or planning these roads were not hawkers or day laborers. They have degrees from colleges, universities. Now after 40 / 45 years, Bengalis are getting Hush. Now the Bengalis are realizing that the plan was wrong. The real reason for this realization is the current intern juggernaut. 50 years ago when there was no Internet, but the roads of different countries in Europe and America were well planned. Their countrymen no longer complain that the roads were unplanned.¬† Now, the difference between Bangladeshi urban planners and European urban planners is education. The knowledge of Bangladeshi engineers is limited to books, they don't know or can't do anything outside of that. Now because of the internet, they have learned something outside of books. See, this takes different borrowings. So borrowing is knowledge. Evidence of this abounds across the country. Dhaka city has many built in which there are serious mistakes somewhere. What happens if you learn by watching this!! Those under supervision do not have the capacity to think in any way.¬†¬†Currently, various projects are being worked on under the supervision of Bangladeshi engineers. Like the people of the country 40 / 45 years ago, you will give all these jobs now.¬† Because you yourself don't know where the mistake is going. The problem is - 40 / 45 years from now when your child realizes it will not be possible to repeat this mistake.¬† In Bangladesh, many new roads can be built because there are still many vacant places. Imagine the population of this small Bangladesh after 50 years. In the last 12 years, the current government has wasted hundreds of kilometers of space by building unplanned flyovers all over Dhaka city. Think how much the countrymen would have benefited if the metro-rail was built on those roads first instead of these unplanned flyovers.¬†¬†¬†< =\"://../?=78\">://../?=78</><>So thinking about the future Bangladesh should go down every road. Up will run , , the car and down will run parallel to , . If roads are built like this, there will be no floods in Bangladesh in the future.¬† These will have endless fish.¬† There will be so much fish that even the poor people can eat 3 meals of fish and rice every day.¬†¬†In Bangladesh, those who want to take various high government positions (chairman, mayor, etc.), want to take responsibility for the development of the country, it is very indispensable for the people to know the level of their general knowledge. I think those who fight or fight to get all these posts should get a wow.¬† This should be. They will be given some example of the country and they will be asked to solve it in their own mind.¬† Even though it is not in Bangladesh, the election must be held and he should not be given that post if he passes this election. They will be made of general knowledge and they should be appointed on the basis of how many rational solutions they provide.¬† And telephone lines will be open for the people of the country. Bangladesh is neither father's country nor son-in-law's country. This country is the people's country. 30 people made this country independent. A public vote will determine whether he is fit for the post. This also applies to Hasina. Since they campaign to get power, they want to sit in the chair of power for the development of the country, improvement of the condition of the people, so their intelligence should be tested before they are put in power.¬† It is necessary to check whether their intelligence or what level of intelligence they will develop the country. {'neg': 0.059, 'neu': 0.874, 'pos': 0.066, 'compound': 0.7051}\n",

            "No country buys every year. A train is purchased for a minimum of 40 years. Hasina will now buy a single-decker train to run on Paddha Setu for a minimum of 40 years. That means no more double-deck trains or metros can be expected in 40 years. Or if after 5 or 10 years the government buys double-decker trains by spending tax money again, what will these single-decker trains do? Would you say that any other line will provide these single-decker trains? In this way, the government will first buy single-decker trains in each sector and then buy double-decker trains with a new budget?¬†¬†Double-deck trains are another convenience factor for people. Let me explain to you - the railway authority calculated that the sale of 1000 rupees was fixed for each compartment in order to make a profit on the train service. If a ticket is sold at Rs 1000 for each compartment, there will be more profit on fuel and other expenses. Now suppose a train compartment with one floor has 50 passengers. The Rs 1,000 ticket sold by the Ministry of Railways is for 50 passengers.¬† (1000 50 = 20) Ticket fare per passenger is supposed to be 20 taka. Now, if you consider a double-deck train compartment, you can comfortably seat at least 80 to 90 passengers in 1st and 2nd floor combined.¬† Now you divide 1000 rupees by 80 passengers ( 1000 80 = 12.25 ) Now you see that due to double-deck train the fare of passengers is also lower. People get another benefit.¬†¬†< =\"://../?=7\">://../?=7&;=328¬†</> ¬†<>If seeking the good of people is not positive, then which is positive bro?¬†Isn't it positive to think about how people will benefit more?¬† Let me tell you how people can benefit from double-decker trains. Why do you call it unfair to want good for the people? If you want the good of the people of the country, why is your liver on fire, brother? I just said that the people would have got more benefits in the double-deck train. Bangladesh is neither the country of one's father nor the country of one's son-in-law, right? The country belongs to the people, you must not deny it, because you are also the people.¬† And who is the champion of corruption and who is left behind is not my concern.

Doesn't Hasina have the power to give more power to these good people so that they can do more good work and encourage good people. Hasina certainly can, but instead of doing it, Hasina does not give these good people any dignity for their work. Hasina is missing and killing hundreds of people, she is not answerable to anyone and this little work is not possible for Hasina?

This extraordinary success is a great honor for the people of Bangladesh, the Bangladesh of Bangabandhu's dream is very much on the map of the world. Reached a better place !! I am originally from Burdwan district of West Bengal, but I was waiting, one day I will go and see the Padma Setu in person !! Finally, I do not have the courage to judge the merits of Sheikh Hasinaji, his actions !! All I can say is that for all the work my mother used to do for our good, we did not thank her separately, we did not greet her with a bouquet of flowers!! The smile of satisfaction on our face was our mother's reward, greeting, everything!! I think that the smile of satisfaction on the face of millions of people of Bangladesh is the biggest debt even to Hon. I wish this to God!! I have two wishes, one- I will go to Bangabandhu's mausoleum and pay my respects!! Two- If there are no protocol obstacles, then I will meet Sheikh Hasinaji and congratulate her for this overall success and pay her respects!! !!All be well, salute !!!!Victory to Bangabandhu, Victory to gold, Victory to Bangladesh !!!!!! {'neg': 0.057, 'neu': 0.697, 'pos': 0.246, 'compound': 0.996}\n",

First was the withdrawal of the World Bank from the project. The Prime Minister said, we will build this bridge with our own money. At first it seemed like an impossible idea. Many cried out. Said about various fears. The air was heavy with various rumors and speculations. Sheikh Hasina went ahead almost alone with this unwavering confidence that such a big project can be done with her own money. He made the impossible possible. Padma Setu is perhaps his greatest contribution to the people of Bengal. Man is mortal, but this bridge will keep his memory alive. It is a surprising fact that this could happen with Bangladesh's own financial capacity, overcoming all obstacles. Padma Setu restored the waning courage of the Bengalis. What Padma Setu will give us in the future is the next thing. For now its greatest achievement is to restore our lost courage. Sheikh Hasina has come through many hardships so far. In a brutal murder in 1975, he lost almost all of his family. His life has been attempted repeatedly. He survived several times somehow. Maybe that darkness was supposed to destroy him from the inside. But each time he stood tall. Proceeded with a very positive determination. Padma Bridge is an indelible symbol of his unwavering determination. The highest achievement of independent Bangladesh is the sky-high dream ‚ÄúPadma Setu‚Äù. Joy Banglaüáßüá©.

Leaving the busyness of the day, I was wandering here and there. Somewhere near the evening, the Azaan is being given on the microphones of some mosques. According to the government's instructions, shops and shopping malls are supposed to be closed by 8 pm. Some shops have closed. Suddenly the cell phone rang, I saw my sonmani calling. Picking up the phone, he said, Dad, there is a good news.... What's up mommy, without saying it, toot toot toot. The line was cut. Husband and wife, we live in Jurain in Dhaka, the girl lives with her maternal grandmother in Shariatpur. I immediately called back. Without receiving the call, I heard the girl's unbridled excitement. Do you know, father, there is a happy news tomorrow... what is it, mommy. Hey, listen tomorrow, padma bridge, Udbhodan Aibo. You go. Khali, shaking hands with Sekh Hasina, Aiba. My daughter has really grown up. He does not understand politics. Awami League-BNP do not understand. He may have understood it by hearing it from his mouth and watching it on TV. Tomorrow something is going to happen in Padmapad. This enthusiasm, this emotion, this pride is not unique to Sona Moni. It is the firm conviction of the people of Bangladesh to hold their heads high. With such emotional joy of the girl, my emotions, love and joy about the Padma Bridge increased thousands of times. Mukh Heke Kenjani Apna some words came out. Yes, father, I will go to Jamu, Sheikh Hasina. I will go to Sheikh Hasina. Yes, father, Sheikh Hasina called me. He said, I will stay at home.
